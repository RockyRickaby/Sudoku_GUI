Sudoku game made in Java :D

## Building and running

Run these on the command line:

```console
mvn package
java -jar ./target/SudokuGUI-<current version>.jar
```

Alternatively, if the second command doesn't work, try this:

```console
java -cp ./target/SudokuGUI-<current version>.jar com.mauro.sudoku.App
```
